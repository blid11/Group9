Hi everyone, 

We should be able to use this Github with Colaboratory or whatever IDE you want that supports Github. 

With Colaboratory it's pretty easy though, you can make your changes and then Save a copy to Github:

The only issue is, we may need to upload the data in the G9 folder as well as the binfpy folder if we need to use either of these.
