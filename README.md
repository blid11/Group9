Hi everyone, 

If you have an IDE that supports Github you can clone this repository, pull the code, commit changes and push to either the main branch or your own branch.

We can also collaborate with Colab without Github at the following notebook:

I've also added a bit of code that loads my Google drive folder G9A2 that has the methylation data in it, but you'll have to copy this folder into your own Google drives if you want to use it (otherwise just comment it out and upload the files).

If you want to make changes under your own branch from Colab (to save a version):
