Hi everyone, 

We should be able to use this Github with Colaboratory or whatever IDE you want that supports Github. 

With Colaboratory it's pretty easy though, you can make your changes and then Save a copy to Github:

The Colab notebook is at the following link: 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/blid11/Group9/blob/main/G9_PartC.ipynb

Unfortunately with Colab it isn't easy to pull the changes that others have made, however we can each have our own branch and if you like what someone else has done you can make your own branch off of their branch and clone it into a new notebook. It will be easier if you have an IDE that supports Github. 

To save the changes you made, go to File > Save a Copy to Github and SAVE IT UNDER YOUR OWN BRANCH:

I've also added a bit of code that loads my Google drive folder G9A2 that has the methylation data in it, but you'll have to copy this folder into your own Google drives if you want to use it (otherwise just comment it out and upload the files).
